main function (Iramir)

This will be the only function with html formatting in it with the "cout" statements.
This cpp does not need a .h file.
This file is the only one with a main method. And can probably be the only method in it.

First you gott print the header. 

Second create a processcgi object.
Then use that object to validate inputs and then return values to store into our main variables.
ie.
ProcessCgi proc = new ProcessCgi

Third, make a game object.
Then use that game object to process the inputs

Fourth and finally print the result.

processcgi object (Vince)

Whoever does this should probably make the index.html because of common var names.

3 fields:
char chosen //the char chosen by the user to select a count for
int count //the int chosen by the user to select 
string text //the text generated from the text file

Needs at least 6 functions:
generateChosen() //uses cgi to validate input and populate the chosen variable
char should not be \n or other weird things.

generateCount() //uses cgi to validate input and populate the count variable
no negatives allowed and should be less than a threshold.

generateText() //uses cgi to validate input and populate the text variable
should be a max length.
generateText should just shove all of the chars into a 1d char array. No point in keeping 2d by \n.

getChosen() //to return to main method
getCount() //to return to main method
getText() //to return to main method

The first 3 can be called by constructor.
Entire program should terminate with message printed if any of the inputs are invalid.

game object (Dan)

3 fields:
char chosen
int count
string text

2 methods:
getResult() //calls countText() and compares to count. returns the difference
countText() //counts the occurences of chosen in text
